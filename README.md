### I should be writing ðŸ¤”

but

Hola! I'm MarÃ­a, from Spain, a computational archaeologist and now Postdoc working on the PalaeoSilkRoad project at University of TÃ¼bingen. Hope you enjoy my git (I don't). I highly recommend [Disturbingmovieslist](https://github.com/Mcotsar/Disturbingmovieslist). You can also see my academic work [here](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=edhP6ewAAAAJ&hl=es), but for nonsense stuff, feminism and science you can follow me on my [twitter](https://twitter.com/Mcotsar) (Spanish / English).
